## Major: Information Systems

This project relates to my major because it is a place where users can enter their last name and a date in which they would like to pick up their medication. I uses a database and SQL to send the last name and date.

## Purpose

This website is for users to make an appointment with the pharmacy to pick up their medications.

## Usage

- Navigate to the website
- Make your appointment
- Close the window

## Future Development

I would like to have more time to fully develop this website. I could not put the time that I would have liked due to a family emergency. 

## Dependencies

None
